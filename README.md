# LX Language

This is my custom compiled language written in C++ based off of the LLVM toolchain. Do not use the language in it's current state unless you are insane.

### Planned features (in order)
- Operations (Maths + BinOp)
- Functions
- More than just int as a type
- References / Pointers
- Structs / Classes (Polymorphism + vtables)

### Codebase
- New features

### Stuff I want to do later (unordered)
- I/O manager (Console, Files)
- Debugger support
- Extensions for vscode / vs22
- Build system
- SSA (Static single assignment)
- LX-Core (Basic Standard Lib)
- SIMD (Single instruction, multiple data)
- Built in features for multi-language codebases (C, C++, C#, Rust...)
- Custom Linker written in rust
- Package manager
- Custom optimiser (as well O3 in Clang)
- Complicated LX-Core:
    - Graphics APIs support
    - Networking support
    - WinAPI compatiability

### Stuff I might do later (but probably won't)
- JIT (Just in time compiler) / Interpreter
- Different compiler backends
- Python support
- Non-windows OS support
- Database support
